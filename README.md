# Chess

This repository contains the source code for a simple two-player Chess game, written in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How to build

The project is built with webpack.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

This command builds the assets into the `dist` directory. `npm start` will start a web server on port 8080, from which the game can be accessed via `localhost:8080`.

## Development

For local development:

```bash
npm run dev-server
```

This will start a development server on port 3000, with hot module replacement enabled.

## Deployment

The project is currently hosted on Heroku, and can be accessed at <https://cecheta-chess.herokuapp.com>.
